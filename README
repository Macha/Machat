This is my Java chat client and server, that I'm doing as a project to practice my Java.

The folders correspond to subpackages of machat: machat.client contains the client, machat.server contains the server and machat.lib contains library classes used by both. In some parts of the program, you may see references to TChat. This was the original name of the program. 

Some of the code (especially the utility classes) is not yet used during normal usage of the program. Some other parts of the code have been auto generated by Netbeans IDE.

The code is under the GPL, not that I can imagine anyone wanting to use it (especially in it's current VERY incomplete state)
