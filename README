This is my Java chat client and server, that I'm doing as a project to practice my Java.

The code is under the GPL, not that I can imagine anyone wanting to use it (especially in it's current VERY incomplete state)

Finally, atm this code uses some classes that Netbeans is providing that apparently are not part of the standard JDK (well compiling with plain old javac gives a load of errors related to missing classes), so for the time being, you will need Netbeans to compile it.
